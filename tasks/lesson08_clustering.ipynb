If we left the distances as is, we'd end up with 3.4 + .24 = 3.64, and 2.6 + 2 = 4.6, which would make the moderate, who is between both parties, seem extreme.

We are going to focus our lesson on a machine learning technique called **clustering**, which allows us to visualize the types of point guards as well as group similar point guards together. **Using 2 features** allows us to easily visualize the players and will also make it easier to grasp how clustering works. For point guards, it's widely accepted that the **Assist to Turnover Ratio** is a good indicator for performance in games as it quantifies the number of scoring opportunities that player created. Let's also use **Points Per Game**, since effective Point Guards not only set up scoring opportunities but also take a lot of the shots themselves\n",

        "**There seem to be 5 general regions**, or clusters, that the point guards fall into (with a few outliers of course!). We can use a technique called clustering to segment all of the point guards into groups of alike players. While regression and other supervised machine learning techniques work well when we have a clear metric we want to optimize for and lots of pre-labelled data, we need to instead use **unsupervised machine learning techniques to explore the structure within a data set that doesn't have a clear value to optimize.**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple ways of clustering data but here we will focus on **centroid based clustering** for this lesson. Centroid based clustering works well when the clusters resemble circles with centers (or centroids). **The centroid represent the arithmetic mean of all of the data points in that cluster.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**K-Means Clustering is a popular centroid-based clustering algorithm that we will use.** The K in K-Means refers to the number of clusters we want to segment our data into. The key part with K-Means (and most unsupervised machine learning techniques) is that we have to specify what k is. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, but one advantage is that we can pick the k that makes the most sense for our use case. We'll set k to 5 since we want K-Means to segment our data into 5 clusters."

        "In this lesson, we explored how to segment NBA players into groups with similar traits. Our exploration helped us get a sense of the 5 types of point guards as based on each player's Assist Turnover Ratio and Points Per Game. In future challenges, you can explore how to cluster using many more features, as well as alternative ways of clustering data without using centroids.\n",

        "We also got to experience the beauty of sklearn and the simplicity of using sophisticated models to get what we need accomplished quickly. In just a few lines, we ran and visualized the results of a robust K-means clustering implementation. When using K-means in the real world, use the sklearn implementation."
